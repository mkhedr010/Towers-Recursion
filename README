Everything worked. 
All of the files were executed and they behave as expected.
The questions in the lab manual are answered in this file 
and the mainTowres file is edited to detect illegal invokations and deal with the command line args to identify the two towers and the other parameters


Question:

Suppose that towers(5, 2, 3) is invoked.

1.      How will the first recursive call to towers() be invoked? Answer this question in the form: towers(x, y, z) where you give the actual values to the three parameters.
2.      How many recursive calls to towers() will be made before this first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation?
3.      Once towers(5, 2, 3) has invoked its first recursive call to towers() and this invocation has returned, what will be printed to stdout? (i.e. What actual move will be made by towers(5, 2, 3) ?)
4.      How will the second recursive call to towers() be invoked? Answer this question in the form: towers(x, y, z) where you give the actual values to the three parameters.


ANS:

1. towers(4, 2, 1)

2. 32

3. 2 3 

4. towers(3, 2, 3)


Question:

Suppose that towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout? 

ANS: 255  =  (2^n) -1
